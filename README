DESCRIPTION

Deros, version 0.1 alpha, September 2024
A communication framework for distributed system for C or C++ projects in Linux environment.

Individual processes running on the same TCP/IP network can register as publishers or subscribers
of messages sent to some address (any character string). Server maintains registrations, but
the communication is peer-to-peer. Publishers and subscribers belong to "nodes" (which is
just a useless abstract bracket for a group of publishers and subscribers that has a name).
Nodes need to initialize their access to the framework first. 
Multiple nodes per process are allowed. Multiple publishers and subscribers per node are allowed.
Multiple publishers/subscribers to the same address even within the same node are also allowed.
Each publisher publishes only to a single address, each subscriber subscribed to a single address. 
Nodes, subscribers, and publishers can be dynamically created and removed during the program run.


   int deros_init(char *server_address, int server_port, char *node_name, int listen_port, char *log_path);

    register as a new node with the specified node_name at a server running at specified IP:port,
    provide listen_port that will be specific to this node - for listening to messages from publishers
    sent to addresses that this node will subscribe to, provide a log_path - a relative or absolute
    path to a folder where debug and message log files will be saved
    Notice: message log needs to be enabled, debug level can be configured with
       void deros_dbglog_set_minimum_level(int min_level);
       void deros_dbglog_enable_level(int level, int enable);

    the returned value is an integer identifier of the node, which needs to be passed to 
    some other functions when interacting with the framework


   void deros_done(int node_id);

    close this node connection to the framework (you can initialize it again later).


   int publisher_register(int node_id, char *address, int message_size, int message_queue_size);

    register as a publisher in a specified node to a specified address,
    messages are typically of fixed size (you specify it here), but variable-len
    messages are allowed (specify -1 as message_size).
    message queues are not supported in this version - messages are delivered immediately,
    reserved for future versions, always use value 1 in this version for compatibility.
    the function returns an integer identifier of this publisher that needs to be passed
    to functions that expect publisher_id.


   int publish(int publisher_id, uint8_t *message, int msg_len);
 
    publish a message from the specified publisher to its publishing address
    (provide message length for "type" checking)
    the message is immediately delivered to all current subscribers.


   void publisher_unregister(int publisher_id);

    remove the specified publisher from the framework agenda when you don't plan to publish
    more messages from this publisher - internal connections with subscribers are automatically closed


   int publisher_log_enable(int publisher_id, int enable);

    enable(1) or disable(0) logging of all messages of the specified publisher to message log

   
   int subscriber_register(int node_id, char *address, int message_size, 
                           subscriber_callback_function callback, int msg_queue_size);

    register a subscriber in a specified node to a specified address,
    specify the expected message size for "type" checking, -1 for messages of variable size,
    provide a callback function that will be automatically called from a different thread
    each time a new message is published to the subscribed address,
    message queues are currently not supported, messages are delivered immediately,
    use value 1, reserved for future versions
    the function returns an integer identifier of this subscriber that needs to be passed
    to functions that expect subscriber_id. 

    The callback function has the following type:

     void subscriber_callback_function(uint8_t *message, int length);

     the message is located in dynamic memory and will be deallocated after the function returns,
     in this version: the callback function is expected to return as soon as possible, 
     otherwise it may block delivering of other messages of this node (each node has a separate thread)


   void subscriber_unregister(int subscriber_id);

    remove the specified subscriber from the framework agenda,
    messages published to the subscribed address will not be delivered to this subscriber anymore


   Since messages are potentially binary packets, their logging (if enabled) is by default implemented
   as printing only printable characters as well as the numeric values of the respective bytes, but
   only max. 100 bytes of each packet. Alternately, the publisher can provide a pretty-print function
   that will convert the binary message to a printable string:

    void publisher_log_prettyprint(int publisher_id, char *(*pretty_printer)(uint8_t *message, int length));

COMPILING

  make


TESTING

  open 3 terminal windows and run the following commands - one per window:

  bin/deros_server --logpath YOUR_LOG_PATH    (or change the default in server/deros_server.h)
  bin/A_test_deros --logpath YOUR_LOG_PATH    (or change in examples/simple/A_test_deros.c)
  bin/B_test_deros --logpath YOUR_LOG_PATH    (or change in examples/simple/B_test_deros.c)


USAGE
